# Workflow Overview

In this project, changes are managed using a simple workflow inspired by GitHub Flow.

1. The `main` branch represents the latest stable version of the documentation.
2. Each change starts from an up-to-date copy of the `main` branch.
3. Contributors create a new branch with a descriptive name for the change they want to make.
4. Changes are committed to that branch in small, focused commits.
5. When the branch is ready, the contributor opens a pull request targeting `main`.
6. Other collaborators review the pull request, leave comments, and suggest improvements.
7. Once the pull request has been reviewed and approved, it is merged into `main`.
8. Old branches are deleted after the merge to keep the repository clean.

This workflow is intentionally lightweight. It is designed to help contributors focus on making clear changes, communicating effectively, and resolving any conflicts that appear.
